# Email Sending Service

Going to create a basic Node.js project that simulates a reliable email sending service using two fake providers.  
It will handle retry logic, fallback, rate limiting, and prevents duplicate emails.

## Features

- Retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- Provider fallback (Provider_01 â†’ Provider_02)
- Idempotency to prevent duplicate emails
- Basic rate limiting
- Logging and status tracking
- Clean, modular folder structure

---
## Folder Structure

src/
â”œâ”€â”€ provider/ # Mock email providers
â”œâ”€â”€ service/ # EmailService logic
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/ # Helpers (retry, rate limit, etc.)
â””â”€â”€ server.js # Express server entry point

## Tech Stack

- Language: JavaScript (Node.js)
- Framework: Express

## Deployment
   Live version hosted on Render

   ðŸ”— https://nm-email-service.onrender.com/send



## How to Run Locally

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/niyaz-malik/email-service
    cd email-service
    npm install
    npm start

## API Endpoint

  GET /
  - welcome message

  POST /send
  - 1Send an email.

    Sample Request body(json): 

    {
    "to": "niyaz@malik.com",
    "subject": "Hello...",
    "body": "Am I a good programmer?"
    }

    Sample Response:

    {
    "success": true,
    "message": "Email sent successfully via provider_modiji"
    }

    If email is duplicate or rate limited, it will tell you.

  Mock Providers:
  - provider_modiji and provider_rahulGandhi are mocked
  - Each randomly succeeds/fails to test retry/fallback logic

  Notes:
  - Idempotency is handled by generating an email ID using SHA-256 hash
  - Rate limit: Max 5 emails per minute
  - Console logs show which provider was used or failed


## What I learnt?
    I learnt deployment and project helped me understand patterns like retries, fallback, and rate limiting. Also I learnt about crypto hashing---for unique id same hashing...
    Hope you like it!
